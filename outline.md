## Method 1 - distances

- Euclidean distance

- Mahalanobis distance

- Intra-class and inter-class comparison
  - Variables combinations
  - Scaling data for covariance calculation

## Method 2 - visualisation

### A. Univariate plots with raw variables

- Better histogram for each variable

### B. Univariate plots with transformed variables

- Principal Components Analysis

- Better histogram for each variable

### C. Bivariate plots with raw variables

- Better scatter plot for each pair variable
